# panorama
A 3D gallery for Joomla3.x
Panorama version 1.0.0  is a free software which is developed by
Kian William Nowrouzian. It is a package including just component.
The license is GNU/GPLv3
It is written for joomla 3.x.
Don't forget the number of images 
must be divisble by the number of columns you choose for the gallery3D and equal or greater than 8.
In comment part for special characters add backslash(\) before them.
In designing this component, I changed the routine of MVC CMS joomla.
In component entrance I contact model and then inject its content
into controller instance and in controller class I contacted view and assigned content of model
and other stuff in view instance and finally calling a method of view instance in controller class. 
So it is not according to the routine of classical joomla component MVC.
